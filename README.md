This web application comes with a number of policies such as: 
- A user can borrow a maximum of 5 books
- A user can renew a book no more than 5 times
- A user cannot borrow or renew books if they have any overdue books
- A user can only rate a book when they return the book and they have never rated the book before
These policies are applied when restricting a user's ability to borrow or renew a book by not making these features accessible until they resolve these policies if they do not follow them. In addition, the application will provide an alert within the user's profile to inform as to why the user cannot use certain features at a given time.

To Install and run this application, a number of steps need to be followed:
